# Olympic Medals Predictor
# Project Overview
This project is a basic machine learning model built using Python and Pandas to analyze Olympic medals data and predict outcomes based on historical trends. It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploration, and model implementation within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

# Features
**Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Reads and cleans Olympic medal datasets, handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies.<br>
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes trends in medal counts by country, sport, and year.<br>
**Feature Engineering:** Extracts meaningful features from the dataset for use in the ML model.<br>
**Model Implementation:** Utilizes a simple machine learning algorithm to predict medal counts or other outcomes.<br>
**Visualization:** Employs Seaborn library for graphical representation of trends and model performance.<br>

# Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

**Python 3.x<br>
Jupyter Notebook<br>
Pandas<br>
NumPy<br>
Matplotlib<br>
Seaborn<br>
Scikit-learn**<br>

You can install the dependencies using:<br>

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
cd olympic-medals-ml
Open Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run the Notebook:

Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Execute each cell to load data, preprocess it, and train the ML model.
Modify as Needed:

Update the dataset or adjust hyperparameters to experiment with different predictions.
Dataset
The model uses an Olympic medals dataset with columns such as:

Year
Country
Sport
Event
Medal
Ensure the dataset is placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the code.

# Model Details
The notebook uses a Linear Regression algorithm from Scikit-learn. The model aims to:

Predict the number of medals a country may win based on historical data.
Classify countries as top medal contenders based on selected features.
# Visualizations
Medal trends over the years for top-performing countries.
Distribution of medals across sports.
Predicted vs actual medal counts.
# Limitations
The model's accuracy depends on the quality and completeness of the dataset.
It does not account for external factors like geopolitical influences or changes in competition rules.
